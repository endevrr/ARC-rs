# ARC-rs

ARC-rs (**A**uto**RC**lone rust) is a complete rewrite of [My first attempt at rewriting AutoRClone in python](https://github.com/endevrr/AutoRclone-Rewrite). I chose rust this time round because it's a compiled language and it's speed.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement [RClone config parser](https://github.com/endevrr/AutoRclone-Rewrite/blob/master/util/config_parser.py) in rust
